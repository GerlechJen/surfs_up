# Surfs Up
I am interested in opening a surf and shake shop which will serve surf boards and icecream to locals and tourists in Oahu. I have some savings I want to invest but will still need real investors to come on board to get it off the ground. I have developed a business plan and reached out to an investor who is famous for his love for suring. However this investor is convcerned about the weather because he invested in a surf shop earlier in his career but the shop went out of operation due to bad weather. He has asked me to run some looking for investors.  a surf and shake shop
