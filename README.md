# Surfs Up
## Overview
I am interested in opening a surf and shake shop which will serve surf boards and icecream to locals and tourists in Oahu. I have some savings I want to invest but will still need real investors to come on board to get it off the ground. I have developed a business plan and reached out to an investor who is famous for his love for suring. However this investor is concerned about the weather because he invested in a surf shop earlier in his career but the shop went out of operation due to bad weather. He has therefore asked me to run some analytics on a weather data set he has of this same Island I want to open the surf shop. 

 The weather data has been stored in a SQLite database.
 
 Analysis was done on precipitation. 
 A plot of precipitation was created in chronological order to show the total precipitation for each day.
 
 Wavy is interested in the most active station(?? more data does not mean accurate results though)
 
 5 routes Precipitation, Stations, Monthly Temperature, Statistics, and a welcome route that will orient W. Avy and his associates to the webpage were created.
